## The Gist

We (the [folks at Stenography](https://www.stenography.dev/)) are on a mission to make code more accessible using machine learning. We hope you love our products and services — from the API to our extensions to the next great idea that we haven’t even thought of yet — as much as we love creating them.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. **These Terms include a mandatory arbitration provision in Section 16. If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.**

We’ve made these Terms available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which means that you’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise them so that your Terms of Service reflect your actual practices. Also, if you do use these Terms, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your website. You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic).

## Terms of Service

These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for [Stenography](https://www.stenography.dev/), [Stenography API](https://stenography-worker.stenography.workers.dev/), (collectively, “Services”).

These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services, like the websites that our users create on WordPress.com. Please note though that the operators of those websites may also have their own separate terms of use.

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services, and this Agreement will apply to any changes.

## 1. Who’s Who

“You” means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using using our Services you're accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

We refer to Stenography Inc., collectively as “Stenography” or “we” throughout these Terms.

## 2. Your Account

When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response.

We may limit your access to our Services until we’re able to verify your account information, like your email address.

When you create a Stenograph.dev account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it’s an email, phone call, or text message.

You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions.

Don’t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.

If you'd like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).

## 3. Minimum Age Requirements

Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if you’re under the age of 13 (or 16 in Europe). If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you’re at least 13 (or 16 in Europe). You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you’re under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.

## 4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users

We haven’t reviewed, and can’t review, all of the content made available through our Services by the model (“Content”) or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We’re not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:

* We don’t have any control over third-party websites.

* A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party website.

* We don’t endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.

* You’re fully responsible for the Content available on your website, and any harm resulting from that Content. It’s your responsibility to ensure that your website’s Content abides by applicable laws and by the Agreement.

* We aren’t responsible for any harm resulting from anyone’s access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You’re responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.

* Any Content that’s for sale through any of our Services is the seller’s sole responsibility, so you must look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Content.

* We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.

  

Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, purchase, or use.

## 5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal

### a. Automattic Fees

**Fees for Paid Services.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like [Stenography Tier Plans](https://wordpress.com/pricing/), and [Stenography Team Plans](https://woocommerce.com/), (collectively, “Paid Services”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team. 

**Taxes.** To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (“Taxes”). You’re responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you’ve paid or will pay, you’re responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment.

**Payment.** If your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you.

**Automatic Renewal.** To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or invoice you (in which case payment is due within 15 days) to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes. By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription to a WordPress.com plan, you’ll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don’t inadvertently disrupt your access to our Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you’ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.

You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for Stenography Paid Services by visiting your [Customer Portal](https://wordpress.com/me/purchases).

You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for Stenography Paid Services by visiting your [Customer Portal](http://woocommerce.com/my-account/my-subscriptions/) or your [API Page](https://stenography-worker.stenography.workers.dev/). 

To review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the respective Service’s website or contact the support team.

You’ll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters) for any reminder emails we might send you before your Paid Services renew.

**Cancelling Automatic Renewal.** You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s website. For example, you can manage all of your Stenography plans through your Stenography [Customer Portal](https://wordpress.com/me/purchases). To cancel a Stenography plan, go to your [Customer Portal](https://wordpress.com/me/purchases), click on the plan you want to cancel, then follow the instructions to cancel the subscription or turn off auto-renew.

For Stenography Paid Services, you can turn off auto-renew for each active subscription at your [Customer Portal](http://woocommerce.com/my-account/my-subscriptions/).

If auto-renew is successfully turned off, you’ll see the date on which your subscription expires. If you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription.

**Fees and Changes.** We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.

**No-Show Policy.** We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your participation (for example, our [Stenography Team Sessions](https://en.support.wordpress.com/concierge-support/#purchasing-a-session)). For instance, this may mean that if you don’t show up or are late for a scheduled session, you’ll still be charged and won’t be entitled to a refund.

**Refunds.** We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we’ll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.


## 6. Feedback

We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we're free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.

## 7. General Representation and Warranty

Our mission is to make coding more accessible to everyone, and our Services are designed to give you control and ownership over your websites. We encourage you to express yourself freely, subject to a few requirements. In particular, you represent and warrant that your use of our Services:

  

* Will be in strict accordance with the Agreement;

* Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside, the use or provision of financial services, notification and consumer protection, unfair competition, and false advertising);

* Will not be for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of illegal activities;

* Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of Automattic or any third party;

* Will not overburden or interfere with our systems or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, as determined by us in our sole discretion;

* Will not disclose the personal information of others;

* Will not be used to send spam or bulk unsolicited messages;

* Will not interfere with, disrupt, or attack any service or network;

* Will not be used to create, distribute, or enable material that is, facilitates, or operates in conjunction with, malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code;

* Will not involve reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, deciphering, or otherwise attempting to derive the source code for the Services or any related technology that is not open source; and

* Will not involve renting, leasing, loaning, selling, or reselling the Services or related data without our consent.

  

## 8. Specific Service Terms

### a. Stenography-worker.stenography.workers.dev Websites and Accounts

[Stenography API](https://stenography-worker.stenography.workers.dev/) enables you to call Stenography directly, and we would love for you to use it. A WordPress.com account also allows you to sign into some of our other Services.

WordPress.com’s basic service is free, and we offer [paid plans](https://wordpress.com/pricing/) that add advanced features like a custom domain name, extra storage, and access to premium themes. We don't own your content, and you retain all ownership rights you have in the content you post to your website. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that nothing prohibited (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appears on your website.

If you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please [let us know](https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/).

**Your WordPress.com Website’s URL.** If you create a website on WordPress.com, you get free use of an Automattic-owned subdomain, like yourgroovysite.wordpress.com or mollys.food.blog. You must not engage in “domain squatting,” claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.

**License.** By uploading or sharing Content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, adapt, publicly display, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving our products and Services and promoting your website. This license also allows us to make any publicly-posted Content available to select third parties (through [Firehose](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/firehose/), for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services. You also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to “reblog” your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website, which the [reblogging](https://en.support.wordpress.com/reblogs/) function on WordPress.com does automatically.

**Removing Content.** If you delete Content, we’ll use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on WordPress.com, but you acknowledge that cached versions of the Content or references to the Content may not be immediately unavailable.

**Web Traffic.** We may use a third-party service to measure WordPress.com’s audience and usage. By having your website on WordPress.com, you agree to assign the traffic for your website to Automattic, and you authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf. This means that your website’s traffic may be included under Automattic, your website may not receive credit for traffic in the respective reports, and you must not assign your website’s traffic to any other party. If we require additional documentation to verify ownership of your website or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to provide it.

**Prohibited Uses.** Your Content and conduct must not violate the [WordPress.com User Guidelines](https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/).

**HTTPS.** We offer free HTTPS on all WordPress.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). By signing up and using a custom domain on WordPress.com, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant’s behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your website.

**Advertisements.** We may display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.

**Attribution.** We may display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, noting that your website is powered by WordPress.com or attributing the creator of your theme, for example. For more details about these attributions, and under which circumstances (if any) you may alter or remove them, please see our [Footer Credit Options support page](https://wordpress.com/support/footer-credits/).

Email. In partnership with Titan (Flock FZLLC), a third-party service provider, we offer you the option to [create email mailboxes](https://wordpress.com/support/add-email/adding-titan-email-to-your-site/) associated with your Domain Name. Your use of Email (powered by Titan) is subject to Titan’s policies, including Titan’s [Customer Terms of Service](https://support.titan.email/hc/en-us/articles/360038024254-Titan-Customer-Terms-of-Use) (for owners of the Email (powered by Titan) subscription), [End User Terms of Service ](https://support.titan.email/hc/en-us/articles/900000761843-Titan-End-User-Terms-of-Use-)(for individuals granted access to mailboxes created by the subscription owner), [Acceptable Use Policy](https://support.titan.email/hc/en-us/articles/900000775226-Titan-Acceptable-Use-Policy), and [Privacy Policy](https://support.titan.email/hc/en-us/articles/360038535773-Titan-Privacy-Policy) in addition to these Terms. These email services are provided “as is.” We make no warranties related to these services and disclaim any obligations or actions of Titan under their policies.

**Domain Names.** We act as a registrar and also work with third-party registrars to provide domain name services. When you register a domain on WordPress.com or transfer an existing domain to WordPress.com, the [policies of the respective registry](https://en.support.wordpress.com/registry-policies/) apply, and you become bound by the relevant registrar’s terms and conditions. Depending on the domain, you may be subject to the terms of the [Automattic Domain Name Registration Agreement](https://wordpress.com/automattic-domain-name-registration-agreement/), [Key-Systems GmbH Registration Agreement](https://www.rrpproxy.net/Legal/Registration_Agreement), [Tucows Domain Inc. Registration Agreement](https://opensrs.com/wp-content/uploads/Tucows_ExhibitA.html), or [this Domain Name Registration Agreement](https://www.secureserver.net/legal-agreement?id=reg_sa&pageid=reg_sa&pl_id=391143), in addition to these Terms. When you register a domain, you’re presented with and must agree to the applicable domain registration agreement. If you didn’t make a note of it, you can look it up at any time. Please see [the Domain Registration Agreements page](http://en.support.wordpress.com/domain-registration-agreements) for instructions on how to determine which domain registration agreements apply to you and your domains. These registrar terms are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

Your domain is also subject to the policies of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). You can read about [your rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits) under ICANN’s Registrar Accreditation Agreement and about [domain name registration generally](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en).

For details about what happens during the domain expiration process and how we may notify you about domain expirations, please see the [Domain Expiration page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-expiration/).

For information about fees associated with domain registrations, renewals, and redemptions, please refer to the [domain pricing and available TLDs page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-pricing-and-available-tlds/).

When you register a domain, you’re required to provide complete and accurate registration information, and you must keep this information current. In most cases, the contact information you provide as part of the registration process will be used as your administrative contact, technical contact, and billing contact for the domain. You can [update your domain contact information](https://wordpress.com/support/update-contact-information/) at any time. If the domain contact information differs from your WordPress.com account information, we consider the administrative contact in your [domain contact information](https://wordpress.com/support/update-contact-information/) to be the owner of the domain, with full authority to manage it.

### b. Stenography Chrome Extension

WooCommerce is an open source, customizable ecommerce platform. The Services we offer at WooCommerce.com give you the power to sell your products and services in whatever way your business needs.

Your use of certain Services offered via WooCommerce.com or [WooCommerce Shipping & Tax](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-services/), like those related to tax calculation, payment, and shipping, may require Jetpack to function. If you enable those features, the Jetpack-specific terms also apply.

**Compatibility, access, updates, and support.** When you purchase Paid Services for WooCommerce, you’ll receive access to any necessary downloads along with updates and support for those Paid Services for a period of one year, starting on the date of your purchase. Once your year is up, you’ll need to renew your subscription if you’d like continued access to updates or support, or if you need to download any files again. Please see our [Support Policy](https://woocommerce.com/support-policy/) for more information.

Please note that extensions and themes are purchased and handled separately, and may function independently. While many work well in tandem, that may not always be the case.



## 9. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe any Content violates your copyright, please see our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy](https://automattic.com/dmca-notice/) and send us a notice.

## 10. Intellectual Property

The Agreement doesn’t transfer any Stenography or third-party intellectual property to you, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property remains (as between Stenography and you) solely with Stenography. Stenography, Stenography Chrome Extension, Stenography API, Stenography Discord Bot, Stenography Slack Bot, Stenography VSC, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our websites or Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Stenography (or Stenography’s licensors). Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Using our Services doesn’t grant you any right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Automattic or third-party trademarks.

## 11. Third-Party Services

While using the Services, you may enable, use, or purchase services, products, software, embeds, or applications (like themes, extensions, plugins, or blocks) developed by a third party or yourself (“Third-Party Services”).

If you use any Third-Party Services, you understand that:

  

* Third-Party Services aren’t vetted, endorsed, or controlled by Stenography.

* Any use of a Third-Party Service is at your own risk, and we won’t be responsible or liable to anyone for Third-Party Services.

* Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and is governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies.

* Some Third-Party Services may request or require access to your data — or to your visitors’ or customers’ data — through things like pixels or cookies. If you use the Third-Party Service or grant them access, the data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices, which you should carefully review before you use any Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may not work appropriately with our Services and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third-Party Services.

* If you have questions or concerns about how a Third-Party Service operates or need support, contact the Third Party directly.

  

In rare cases we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third-Party Services from your account or website.

If you purchase Google Workspace or G Suite, there are a few other things we want to highlight: these services are provided by Google, and your use of them is subject to [Google’s Terms of Use](https://workspace.google.com/terms/premier_terms.html) for the services, which you’ll accept before using Google Workspace or G Suite for the first time. We’re an authorized reseller of Google Workspace and G Suite, but make no warranties about Google’s services, and disclaim Google’s liability for any damages arising from our distribution and resale of their services. Google will provide technical support for its services, per its [Technical Support Services Guidelines](https://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/terms/tssg.html).

## 12. Changes

We may update, change, or discontinue any aspect of our Services at any time. Since we’re constantly updating our Services, we sometimes have to change the legal terms under which they’re offered. The Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Stenography, or if Stenography posts a revised version. We’ll let you know when there are changes: we’ll post them here and update the “Last Updated” date, and we may also post on one of our blogs or send you an email or other communication before the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services after the new terms take effect will be subject to the new terms, so if you disagree with the changes in the new terms, you should stop using our Services. To the extent you have an existing subscription, you may be eligible for a refund.

## 13. Termination

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your API key for misuse, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any the Agreement or any Stenography policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.

You can stop using our Services at any time, or, if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.

## 14. Disclaimers

Our Services are provided “as is.” Stenography and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither Stenography, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. If you’re reading this, thank you :). You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.

## 15. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.

Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services that are not otherwise subject to arbitration (as indicated below) will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.

## 16. Arbitration Agreement

Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.

## 17. Limitation of Liability

In no event will Stenography, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to Automattic under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. Automattic shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

## 18. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Automattic, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.

## 19. US Economic Sanctions

You may not use the Services if such use is inconsistent with U.S. sanctions law or if you are on any list maintained by a U.S. government authority relating to designated, restricted or prohibited persons.

## 20. Data Processing Agreement

If you need a data processing agreement (DPA) with us for the GDPR requirements that apply to us as a data processor for your website, please follow [these instructions](https://en.support.wordpress.com/automattic-gdpr/data-processing-agreements/).

## 21. Translation

These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.

## 22. Miscellaneous

The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Automattic and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

Automattic may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.
